Shawty, thatâ€™s enough (Oh my God, cior)
Ayy, Benihana, straight to go when I met you
Ricky O', Balenciaga my sweatsuit
She said "Don, you got my heart so don't
Break it, I been goin' through too much
I won't let you"
Where you at? I'm mobile now, I can meet you
Ain't no fuckin' way
You still where I left you
Ain't no fuckin' way
You on the edge of the cliff
And wonderin' if I'ma catch you
Know that you wanna watch me blow a check
And I know that you know you
Wanted me to wreck you
Pull up, I'm at the club
It's 3AM and I'm drunk so I'm
Sorry if I disrespect you
We in LA, I'm sippin' gin and juice, bitch
I feel like I'm Snoop and roll another
Smoke all the problems
Weighin' down my mental
Watch me take out a hundred
Use it like a tissue
Benihana, straight to go when I met you
Ricky O', Balenciaga my sweatsuit
She said "Don, you got my heart so don't
Break it, I been goin' through too much
I won't let you"
Matter of fact, boy
Sometimes I be wishin' I ain't never met you
That's a fact
But I know that you still been
Wantin' me to catch you (Never mind)
You said it's too hard for me to feel love
(Woah, In my mind)
I'm tryna figure out what's real and
Which part was made up
Shawty, that's enough, neon guts
She so tired of throwing up
I'm feeling like I did
Too much, pockets full
But my heart bankrupt
(Now my pockets full, but my
Heart on bankrupt, Hey, hey)
(Now my pockets full
But my heart on bankrupt)
Shawty, that's enough, neon guts
She so tired of throwing up
I'm feeling like I did
Too much, pockets full
But my heart bankrupt
How did you know?
I been blowin' money like I don't give a damn
I ain't hurtin', that's as far as she knows
Twelve o'clock
We let that shit hit the ceiling fan
Now I'm bugging and I'm out of control
Keep on looking at the past
Like I'm who made it, yeah
Two blunts I'm too faded, yeah
Lost you on my way, yeah, lost
A few on my way, yeah
I switch up the whip, now it's futurama
It's electric
Swervin' the Elon Musk, like it's a Lexus
And bitch, you be silent, I'on do the talkin'
I feel like I'm Charlie
Chaplin with the extras
Like, give me a minute
On my dick so damn much I'm offended
ATL, I'm shopping spree
I treat a thirty ball
Like I ain't never had me a penny
Threw it all in Lenox
Ayy, Benihana, straight to go when I met you
Ricky O', Balenciaga my sweatsuit
She said "Don, you got my heart so don't
Break it, I been goin' through too much
I won't let you"
Matter of fact, boy
Sometimes I be wishing I ain't never met you
That's a fact (Woah, woah, woah)
But I know that you still just
Wanted me to catch you
(Never mind) , you said it's too
Hard for me to feel love, woah
(In my mind)
I'm tryna figure out what's real and
Which part was made up
Shawty, that's enough, neon guts
She so tired of throwing up
I'm feeling like I did
Too much, pockets full
But my heart bankrupt
(Hey, hey hey hey hey hey)
(Now my pockets full
But my heart on bankrupt)
(Now my pockets full
But my heart on bankrupt)
Shawty, that's enough, neon guts
She so tired of throwing up
I'm feeling like I did
Too much, pockets full
But my heart bankrupt
Never mind
